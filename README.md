## GUI# Java Swing Calculator

This is a simple calculator application built using Java Swing. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also logs operations to a file.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Logs operations to a file (`log.txt`).
- Simple and intuitive GUI built using Java Swing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

### Running the Calculator

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maryamjbr/simple-calculator.git
    cd simple-calculator
    ```

2. Compile the Java source file.

    ```bash
    javac calculator.java
    ```

3. Run the compiled Java program.

    ```bash
    java calculator
    ```

### Using the Calculator

- **Numbers:** Click on the number buttons (0-9) to input numbers.
- **Operations:** Click on the operation buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform arithmetic operations.
- **Decimal Point:** Click on the `.` button to add a decimal point.
- **Equals:** Click on the `=` button to compute the result of the operation.
- **Clear:** Click on the `clear` button to reset the input fields.
- **Log:** Click on the `log` button to print the log of operations to the console.

### Code Structure

- **Main Class:** The `calculator` class contains the main method and the GUI components.
- **Method:** The `answer` method computes the result of the arithmetic operation.

### Example

To add two numbers:

1. Click on `2`.
2. Click on `+`.
3. Click on `3`.
4. Click on `=`.

The result (`5`) will be displayed in the text field.
